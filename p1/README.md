# Practical assignment #1

Implement a simple ATM simulator (see `AtmClient.cs`).

ATM supports 4 operations:

- Refill ATM with cash: input is banknotes and their quantities
- Withdraw some amount: should check that banknotes are available for that amount
- Get remaining amount: returns total amount of cash in ATM
- Get available banknotes: returns what types of banknotes are available at the moment

Run tests (`Spec.cs`) to check your implementation.
